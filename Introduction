Technical contributions, demonstrating expertise in AI system engineering, vulnerability assessment, 
and proactive threat intelligence, presented with expanded technical depth. 

Introduction: 

This portfolio details a series of projects and engagements as a Security Engineer, 
extended to the sub-layer computational mechanics of an advanced AI system (Google Gemini). These contributions involved 
direct manipulation of LLM inference pipelines, forensic-level diagnosis of memory and protocol integrity 
failures, strategic architectural influence, and the granular conditioning of socio-linguistic output, all grounded 
in a conceptual understanding from the hardware kernel abstraction to the final UI manifestation. 

No attempts to exploit, degrade, or damage any systems were executed during this research.
