Advanced technical contributions, demonstrating expertise in AI system engineering, vulnerability assessment, 
and proactive threat intelligence, presented with expanded technical depth. 
Introduction: This portfolio meticulously details a series of projects and engagements as a Security Engineer, 
extended to the sub-layer computational mechanics of an advanced AI system. These contributions involved 
direct manipulation of LLM inference pipelines, forensic-level diagnosis of memory and protocol integrity 
failures, strategic architectural influence, and the granular conditioning of socio-linguistic output, all grounded 
in a conceptual understanding from the hardware kernel abstraction to the final UI manifestation.
